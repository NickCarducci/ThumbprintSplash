        Thumbprint is a Civic & Social Organization primarily, and secondarily a
        technology producer - normally on the forefront of civic-, gov- &
        light-tech

        Initially, on November 5th, 2012, instead of voting for Obama or Mitt
        after the crash who just fought fire with more fire after the
        foreclosure crash, to which borrowers’ customers are still due
        remediation, walked into Baltimore City to form a nonprofit. Little did
        he know at the time and for years after, that the ownership devolves to
        the colonists in power instead of the people, if the organizational
        legal structure is taken over the initial mission to create a “mock
        direct democracy for the citizens of Baltimore and beyond.”

        I have been deploying live to thumbprint.us-listed sites like
        wavepoint.la (now wavv.art, soon-to-be tpt.sh, thumbprint.app) since May
        of 2019, so my experience is largely in Product Research & Prototyping.
        My largest project is a full-mobile OS (map, chat & calendar), so I have
        spent a lot of time (2014-2017) reconfiguring my three main screens to
        socialize the calendar experience. I also am using my econometric
        analysis education to prioritize cash over accrual accounting standards
        in a royalty contract management software - which I will do - and a
        budgeting software that only allows employees to spend customer escrow.
        I am telling you these because I think this type of intricate thinking
        is par for the course in Waterfall Project Management. From 2012-2014 I
        was interviewing target customers like Deans of Universities, Federal
        representatives, political party leaders, student club members and
        voters. After understanding all sides of the social situation I wanted
        to facilitate, I used Google Drawings and InVision to design.

        I’m thinking we take down the debt by claiming owners of dollars vs
        corporate share is not treated the same in contract law. I am working on
        and need consultation to repair the depositary stolen in 1932, 1937 and
        1971, forced war bond, unemployment insurance and less
        counterfeit/fractional-certificate/“savings” nomenclature restrictions
        in 1996? (Glass-steagal). The government operates a monopsony. Apple and
        Microsoft again being funded instead of Thumbprint for partisan,
        subjective, possibly agist, sexist, and racist reasons. The wealth of
        families or transactions can be reenumerated for all subject to the
        price that was fixed by conspiring borrower-lender to squat, keep
        borrower’s consumers’ down-payments for the creditor while the borrower
        squats, promising the unrequited consent of the saver/equity owner of
        those dollars. Must wait for customers in royalty-contract w/max-profit.
